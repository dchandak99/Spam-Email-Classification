# Spam-Email-Classification


### Analysis of ML Algorithms for Spam Email Classification in Python :
**Highlights**:
- Anaylzed KNN, Naive Bayes, SVMs and Neural Networks and finally implemented **Naive Bayes** and **KNN** for the classification of various data sets into **spam and ham** using *Keras*, Pandas, Numpy and *Scikit-learn*
- Compared accuracies for various data sets and **categorised the best method** for each data set

**Details:**
My interest in Applied Machine Learning was first kindled during my research stint at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur under Professor Vipul Arora, of the Electrical Engineering Department, just after my first year of Undergraduate Study. The project entitled Analysis of ML Algorithms for Spam Email Classification in Python involved a detailed analysis of K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks. I also implemented Naive Bayes and KNN for the classification of various data sets into spam and ham. Extensive use was made of the Keras, Pandas, Numpy and Scikit-Learn libraries. I also compared accuracy rates for various data sets and categorised the best method for each data set. My presentation on my findings received special mention from the Professor.

To **run the code**:-

1. run the command "python3 knn.py" for K-nearest neighbours algorithm and "python3 naive_bayes.py" for naive bayes algorithm on command line and you will get to see the accuracies for the dataset.

2. emails.csv is the **dataset** used.
